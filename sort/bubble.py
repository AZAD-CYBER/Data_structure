#Performance Based Analysis of Bubble Sort Algorithm
# Pros
# Easy to implement
# Cool to implement
# Gives the largest value of array in the first iteration itself.
# Or the smallest value of array in the first iteration itself (Minor tweak in implementation)
# No demand for large amounts of memory for operation
# Cons
# Noob (Bad) algorithm ğŸ˜€
# Very horrible time complexity of O(n2)
# Interesting Facts
# Average and worst case time complexity: o(n2)
# Best case time complexity: n when array is already sorted.
# Worst case: when the array is reverse sorted.
